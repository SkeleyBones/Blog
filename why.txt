Well I've always liked computers since I was little and learning about the internet at a young age really changed me (I think for the better)
Another factor is just outside influencers i.e. friends, family, and even teachers. Also I just really like math; knowing the outcome is correct as long as everything has been processed correctly is very satisfying. I hope that doesn't make me a boring person, I always appreciate a bit of rng in my life.
