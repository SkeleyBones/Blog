Well I've always liked computers since I was little and learning about the internet at a young age really changed me (I think for the better)
Another factor is just outside influencers i.e. friends, family, teachers, and of course th internet. Tbh I just really like math to; there's always set rules and knowing that you'll always have the right outcome if everything
