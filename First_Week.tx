I'm going to be honest I didn't learn much due me arlready taking a coding class but I did enjoy the lectures and it was a nice refresh of my memory.
Regarding other things such as Scratch, personally I am not very fond of it as It can be very inconsistant and buggy. It doesn't give a full grasp of real coding as id rather type down my code.
I hope next week will have a better structure. I want to learn something new.
